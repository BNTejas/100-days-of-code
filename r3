At this point I don't even know what to say, I really need to make it a habit to code everyday. I don't know why I do this,
I am questioning whether I really like coding or, I don't know, now that that thought crept up in my head. I got like million 
memories why I love coding. Somewhere I must have lost the way, for the past few years I have been looking coding as a career. That
might happen eventually, but that's not why I wanted to code. I coded for the sheer joy of it. The things I could do, the happiness.
That great feeling when you have to solve something or come up with an algorithm for something. That just drives me. I code to learn
not to earn. I should not think or learn coding to live a great life. I want to do it because I love it.

Today I revisited all the assignments I had previosuly done atleast twice. This time around I did not want to waste my time 
doing the same thing again. Therefore, I just worked on the assignments again and turns out remember most of it.Tommorrow, I plan
on catchin up with the rest and going ahead much further. Also to take a break, I will look ideas and desgings, inspirations,
for my portfolio to learn.
