This is my second attempt at the 100 days of code challenge hope this works well for me. I have a lot of goals but I'm not gonna state any, 
I'll just put my head down and keep working. Today I have started on the web developer bootcamp by colt steele on udemy, I am breezing through
the first few units as they seem to be easy!
